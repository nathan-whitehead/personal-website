There are multiple color uses:

1. Backgrounds/surfaces
2. Text
3. Borders
4. Icons

Backgrounds need to be mostly muted, neutral colors
Text needs a lot of variations. Neutral contrasting with the background, light variants contrasting with icons, colored variants for emphasis, hyperlinks, etc
Border colors - need similar colors as text (reuse text), and for more subtle borders use darker forms of background colors
Icons need bright colors, both brand colors, and functional such as danger, warning, etc.


naming convention:

background colors are sf-elevation (1-5)

text/line colors are ln-variant-elevation (1-3) 
	variants would include: [normal, muted, primary, secondary, danger, warning, info, success]
	
border colors are bd-(variant?)-elevation (1-5)
	this is generally a slightly darker version of the surface color. Line colors could also easily be used for borders (hence generic name “line”)
	
Icon colors are ic-variant-elevation (1-3)
	variants include the same as lines
