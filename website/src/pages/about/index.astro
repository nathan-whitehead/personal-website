          I was born in 2001 in Dallas, Texas, but I grew up in Edmond,
          Oklahoma. I graduated from Edmond Santa Fe High School in 2019 and
          went on to study Industrial Engineering at Oklahoma State University.
          I graduated in 2023 with a Bachelor of Science in Industrial
          Engineering.

        <p>
          Following my graduation, I moved to Bremerton, Washington to work as
          an Industrial Engineer at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard. There I gained
          valuable experience in the field, working on various projects and
          collaborating with talented professionals.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, I made the decision to return to Dallas, Texas, where I am
          currently pursuing a Master's degree in Computer Science at the
          University of Texas at Dallas.

          Hobbies

          I love to travel and explore new places, especially hiking in the
          mountains and visiting new cities. I also enjoy photography, capturing
          moments from my adventures and sharing them with friends and family.
          Some of my photos can be found in the blog <a href="/blog/photos"
            >under photos.</a

        <p>
          I also enjoy watching movies and playing video games. My movie diary
          can be found on <a
